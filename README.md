# Hey there 👋, I'm Yuri

### I’m a Data Scientist at Arcotech, where I create data products from modeling to deployment that impact education

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Software Design and Generative AI**

- 🤝 I'm looking to **collaborate within the open-source community** as a way to give back for the vast and invaluable FOSS projects found throughout the internet

- 💬 Ask me about **anything related to data science, software development or AI**

- 👟 Fun fact: **I run marathons**

<br>
Most of my projects are private within Arcotech's scope, and the majority of my personal projects are either local or private. However, I'm moving towards embracing the #LearnInPublic concept by progressively sharing my work and progress on GitHub. As I continue, I'll create public repositories to share my learnings and projects over time. Stay tuned! 😉
